## PROJECT OVERVIEW（プロジェクト概要）
This section will describe the overall goals and objectives of the project. The project includes tools for AI-driven product sales and original character creation.  Tools include Autobooru (Yahoo Auction version), Autobooru_X, TXT MATOME, WD14 Tagger, Cline, Cursor, Grok, and o1 Pro.  The project aims to streamline workflows for these tasks using automation and AI analysis. A PowerShell script (`autobooru_workflow.ps1`) automates the process from seller ID input to data analysis, triggered by a single button.  The workflow includes a menu-driven interface for ease of use and allows for customization of output folders and paths.  The workflow automates image download and analysis from Yahoo Auctions, X (formerly Twitter), and processes already downloaded images.  The workflow is designed to be initiated with a single button press.  All tools should be used within a virtual environment for proper deployment.  The project leverages AI for efficient product sales and original character creation.  The project now includes a comprehensive workflow automation script (`autobooru_workflow.ps1`) for streamlined processing. The project uses a `metacard` folder containing at least `説明.txt`. The project now includes a `simple_tag.py` script for handling WD14 Tagger tasks. Autobooru utilizes Yahoo Auction seller IDs (e.g., nvqnv96308) as input.  The project includes a standalone WD14 Tagger implementation (`WD14_Tagger_Standalone`).  The project includes a `prompt_converter.py` script for YAML conversion. The project includes a `simple_yaml.py` script for generating a simplified YAML file based on a template.  The project includes a `create_clean_yaml.py` script for generating a clean YAML file from tagged results. The project includes a `simple_yaml.py` script for generating a simplified YAML file based on a template.  Autobooru, Autobooru_X, TXT MATOME, and WD14 Tagger are integrated into a single workflow via `autobooru_workflow.ps1`.  The workflow is fully documented in `MetaCard_README.md`.  The project includes a `create_clean_yaml.py` script for generating a clean YAML file structured like `0413_haifu.yaml`.  The `0413_haifu.yaml` file serves as a template for structuring YAML outputs.  Autobooru uses seller URLs (e.g., `https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/seller/nvqnv96308`).  The project includes `eva02_tagger.py` for tagging images with the eva02 model. The `prompt_converter.py` script from TXT MATOME should be used for YAML conversion. The `prompt_converter_gui.py` script can be used for a GUI-based YAML conversion. The `autobooru_workflow.ps1` script must handle seller URLs (e.g., `https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/seller/nvqnv96308`) correctly. The `autobooru_workflow.ps1` script must include a `Test-ToolPath` function.  The project includes `create_wildcards_yaml.py` and `create_wildcards_yaml_dated.py` for generating wildcard YAML files.  The project includes `convert_to_template.py` for generating YAML files structured like `0413_haifu.yaml`. The `eva02_tagger_categorized.py` script must handle image dimensions (448x448 pixels) correctly. All images must be 448x448 pixels before processing with the eva02 tagger. The `eva02_tagger_categorized.py` script must be used for all eva02 model tagging tasks.  タグ関連の操作は個人情報の取り扱いと同レベルの慎重さで行うこと。タグデータは元のまま保持し、明示的な指示なしに変更や削除を行わないこと。特に「キャラクター」カテゴリのタグは絶対に勝手に変更しないこと。タグの追加・削除・編集はすべてユーザーの明確な指示に基づいて行い、変更履歴を記録すること.
